# Indoor Localization & tracking

Indoor localization and tracking technology is becoming a fundamental element on several industries including the warehouses, sports analytics, and biomedical applications.

# Task Idea:
- WiFi tracking module where a bracelet can be attached to an object and the user can localize and track the current location of the object in real time through either a mobile application or a website.
- Data is collected at Cairo University Faculty of Engineering Biomedical Engineering Department. 

# Features:
- The user can visualize a basic map for the location and see a flashing point moving on the map representing the tracked moving object.
- The user can replay the motion of the object during the last time period (corresponding to like 50 time point). The replay path should be displayed in a different color. It up to your choice whether the replay will be a different mode in your app or will run in parallel to the real-time tracking mode. You just need to justify your choice.
